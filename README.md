# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Sorting algorithm is an alorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.
The order itself can be:
	* numerical order
	* lexicographical order
	* ascending or descending order
Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms(search and merge) that require input data to be in sorted lists.
Sorting is also useful in canonicalization(normalization) of data into human readable form.
Requirements for output of any sorting algorithm:
 * output should be monotonic order - smaller/larger than the previous element
 * permutation output(reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.
Input data should be stored in a data structure which allows random access rather that one that allows only allows sequential access.

Comparison sorting algorithms have a fundamental requirement of Î©(n log n) comparisons (some input sequences will require a multiple of n log n comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array to be sorted). Algorithms not based on comparisons, such as counting sort, can have better performance.

Some algorithms concepts that i came through while doing these tasks include:
* big O notation
* divide-and-conquer algorithms
* data structures such as heaps and binary trees
* randomized algorithms
* best, worst and average case analysis
* time-space tradeoffs
* upper and lower bounds.
